## Step 1: Create a claims aware Relying Party Trust using federation metadata

In AD FS, a relying party (RP) trust needs to be set up. You can supply our SP metadata file, usually located at `https://<your-hosted-url>/.well-known/sp-metadata` and let AD FS automatically pick up the configuration.

If you are manually entering the details then you'll find the details you need in [this section](./generic-saml.md). The public certificate is needed for Signature verification and is usually located at `https://<your-hosted-url>/.well-known/saml.cer` for Signature verification.

You will also need to map some attributes of the claims so we can fetch the profile information for your user.

1. In Server Manager, click Tools, and then select AD FS Management.
2. Under Actions, click Add Relying Party Trust.
