## Step 2: Configure Application

Copy the **Idp Metadata URL** or **Idp Metadata XML** from the next screen. You'll need this value to configure your SAML connection in SAML Jackson.

You'll need to enter the **ACS URL** and **Entity ID**. You'll get these values from SAML Jackson.

Make sure that **Service Provider Entity ID** matches the **SAML Audience (SP Entity ID)** value from SAML Jackson.

From the **Settings** tab of custom app you just created. Go to **Advanced SAML Settings** section and check the box for **Disable InResponseTo field in assertions for IdP initiated SSO**.

This is because Rippling sends dummy values for the **InResponseTo** field and SAML Jackson will try to validate the **InResponseTo** field if it is present.
