## Step 1: Generic SAML

This guide explains the settings youâ€™d need to use to configure SAML with your Identity Provider. Once this is set up you should get an XML metadata file that should then be configured using our [API (or calling the API controller connection method if using our NPM)](../sso-flow/index.md#21-add-connection).

> Please do not add a trailing slash at the end of the URLs.

Create them exactly as shown below:

- Assertion consumer service URL / Single Sign-On URL / Destination URL: `http://localhost:5225/api/oauth/saml`

- Entity ID / Identifier / Audience URI / Audience Restriction: `https://saml.boxyhq.com`

- Response: `Signed`

- Assertion Signature: `Signed`

- Signature Algorithm: `RSA-SHA256`

- Assertion Encryption: `Unencrypted`

:::info
The deployed Jackson service has a Service Provider (SP) endpoint that exposes the above metadata and the same can be accessed at `<jackson_endpoint>/.well-known/saml-configuration`.
