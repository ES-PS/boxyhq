## Step 1: Create Application

From your Google Admin console, click **Apps** from the sidebar then click **Web and mobile apps** from the list.

If your application is already created, choose it from the list and move to the next step.

If you haven't created a SAML application, click **Add custom SAML app** from the menu.
